# Resolve Merge Conflicts

1. Go into your Github Desktop Client and open up your repository.  
2. Switch the branch to *development*.  
3. Click on *sync*.
4. Go back to your branch and update from *development*.
5. It will tell you there are merge conflicts. Click to see them.  
6. Look at the unchecked boxes. Fix the mistakes in those files by removing the <<<<<, =====, and >>>>>. If there is duplicate code, remove the code that is older.  
7. Check the boxes that you just fixed and commit.  
8. Sync your branch and check the [pull requests](https://github.com/TheRedBalls/Final-Project/pulls) to ensure your PR can be automatically merged.
